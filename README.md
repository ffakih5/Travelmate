## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stemmed from the shared yearning to pack up and go on a trip by the members of the group. 

We drew on our personal experiences with travel and brought to light what we consider to be the key elements to ensuring you have a successful trip, wherever your destination may be!

## Process
We began with concept creation which then centered around our Travel Briefing API. We knew we wanted an information hub for travellers, that would present a consolidated source of key travel insights for any country to make it easy to plan a trip or write a blog. 

We then came to the conclusion that the second API would be a currency converter as this was something we thought was missing from the Travel Brieifng API but important to our intended users.

We decided that we would need the site to have searchability as well as the ability to bookmark countries you had searched for before.
